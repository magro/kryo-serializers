/**
 * A kryo {@link com.esotericsoftware.kryo.Serializer} that allows to exclusively include or exclude fields that
 * are attributed with user-specific annotations. This can be for example useful when serializing beans that carry
 * references to a dependency injection framework. As an example for Spring:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Set<Class<? extends Annotation>> marks = new HashSet<>();
 * marks.add(org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired.class);
 * SerializerFactory factory = new FieldAnnotationAwareSerializer.Factory(marks, true);
 * Kryo kryo = new Kryo();
 * kryo.setDefaultSerializer(factory);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * the resulting {@link Kryo} instance would ignore all fields that are annotated with Spring's {@code @Autowired}
 * annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Similarly, it is possible to created a serializer which does the opposite such that the resulting serializer
 * would only serialize fields that are annotated with the specified annotations.
